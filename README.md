## Getting Started

- Fork and clone this repository.
- Run `open index.html` to open your game in the browser (Mac).
  - `cmd + option + i` or `ctrl + shift + i` to **open your dev tools** in your browser.
- You'll be working in the `index.html` file, `app.js` in the `js` folder, and `style.css` in the `css` folder.

## Requirements
- A user should be able to click on different squares to make a move.
- Every click will alternate between marking an `X` and `O`
- A cell should not be able to be replayed once marked.
- You should not be able to click remaining empty cells after the game is over.
- Add a reset button that will clear the contents of the board.
- Display a message to indicate which turn is about to be played.
- Detect draw conditions (ties/cat's game) 
- Detect winner: Stop game and declare the winner if one player ends up getting three in a row. 
  - Hint: Determine a set of winning combinations. Check those combinations on the board contents after every move.

**Have Fun** - The best way to learn is by playing with code. Let creativity guide you and try some experiments with JS and CSS and see what you can do.

## Bonuses

- Implement your reset button without refreshing the whole page
- Track player's wins over time
- Add a simple AI to support one player vs computer mode. In this case, "simple" just means having the computer pick a random empty square.
- Make your computer seem more human by adding a short time delay between your turn and the computer's turn.
- Style it up! Get creative, or even make a theme!
