## Getting Started

- Fork and clone this repository.
- Run `open index.html` to open your game in the browser (Mac). You can use the Live Server as well.

## Requirements
- A user is be able to click on different squares to make a move.
- Every click will alternate between marking a Diamond: :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: and Heart :heartpulse:
- A cell won't not be able to be replayed once marked.
- Players won't be able to click remaining empty cells after the game is over.
- A reset button that will clear the contents of the board.
- Detect winner: Stop game and declare the winner if one player ends up getting three in a row. 

**Future Enhancements** 
- Display a message to indicate which turn is about to be played.
- Detect draw conditions (ties/cat's game)
  
## Possible Streach goals
- Implement the reset button without refreshing the whole page
- Track player's wins over time
- Add a simple AI to support one player vs computer mode. In this case, "simple" just means having the computer pick a random empty square.
- Make your computer seem more human by adding a short time delay between your turn and the computer's turn.
